Skill Swap 🤝✨

Skill Swap is a collaborative platform where users can exchange skills with each other. Instead of simply requesting help, users must offer one of their own skills in return — creating a fair, engaging, and community-driven learning environment.

🚀 How It Works

🔍 Browse Skills → Explore what others are offering.

🎯 Offer a Skill → Share something you’re good at.

🔄 Request in Return → Ask for help with a skill you want to learn.

✅ Swap Completed → Both users grow together through collaboration.

Your mission:
Learn new things while helping others — no money, just skill-for-skill exchange!
